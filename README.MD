#QuizApp - Rent Calculator

## Description
QuizApp's rent calculator was a commissioned project for a real estate brokerage to find out how much one can afford with the rent they pay. Languages include a versitile and responsive HTML/CSS using JQUERY and Javascript. When user enters their monthly rent payment, algorithm uses a reversed present value formula to compute compounded present value over a 30 year term pulling current rates from Zillow API. The form in production uses ReCaptcha services and Twilio Verify OTP to prevent bots. Once compound interest present value is found, site then shows the current homes on the market today with a query params based on location, high-to-low, and max-purchase price.
